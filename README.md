## Background
1) evaluate various prediction models for DSE of CPU.
2) a hypervolume-improvement-based multi-objective optimization method and a uniformity-aware selection algorithm to select design points.
Further, AdaBoost is first introduced to GBRT model to improve the prediction accuracy.

## Install

This project uses torch, skopt, math, and several basic python package. Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

## Usage

This is only a documentation package.

```sh
# run main() in main.python
$ python main.python
```
